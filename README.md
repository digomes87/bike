## Installation

OS X ,Linux & Windons:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/digomes87/bike.git

## Usage example

Like any back end programmer, my layouts have never been very beautiful, I have decided to change that, and since then I look for references, courses, and apply a little of that every day. Here is one of the results I liked the most.


## Development setup
  Here in just a html css and javascript, you can use this, but for apply in a CMS you will need a web designer or developer for apply.
