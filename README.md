## Installation

OS X ,Linux & Windows:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/digomes87/bike.git
```


## Usage example

Like many back end programmers, my layouts have never been very beautiful. I decided to change that, and looked for design references and courses, then apply a little of that knowledge every day. Here is one of the results I liked the most.


## Development setup
  This is a front-end design made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To apply with a CMS, you will need a web designer or developer to integrate it with a back-end.
